            My name is Allison Bardy. I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I graduated from Hunter College City University of New York and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. I have explored many career fields, but was never passionate about them. I have always had an interest in math and science and was recently introduced to softerware engineering.</p>
            <p>I am determined to learn the skills and knowldge required to build a career in coding. I am very excited to be a part of Columbia's coding bootcamp and hope that I will master coding by the end of the program and be confident when interviewing with potential employers.</p>
